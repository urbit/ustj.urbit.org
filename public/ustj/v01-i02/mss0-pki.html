<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   A public key infrastructure (<span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki</span>) is a system for binding a
set of keys to a name. Sometimes a small amount of metadata
is included. Existing <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki</span>s include <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pgp</span>-style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust" >“web of trust”</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority" ><span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">ssl</span>
certiﬁcates</a>, <a href="https://www.zerotier.com/lf-announcement/" >ZeroTier</a>, <a href="https://keybase.io/" >Keybase</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/what-is-openid/" >OpenID</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Persona" >Mozilla Persona</a>, and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/identity" >Login with Google</a>. These take unique approaches to
the problem and have achieved some degree of success,
but none provide globally consistent, permanent, and
completely self-owned identities. In this article, we will
describe Urbit’s approach to achieving these properties in its
<span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki</span>.
</p><!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Urbit’s <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>is named “Azimuth” (or occasionally “Urbit
ID”). Azimuth is Urbit’s identity layer, built as a suite of
smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and several apps
run locally on your “ship”. (In Urbit, a “name” is often called
a “ship” or an “address” because we use the metadata in the
<span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>to make names routable.) The total data is two 256-bit
asymmetric keys, a cryptographic suite number (to allow
changing crypto algorithms), the revision number of the key,
and the name of a ship that will route for it. This sums to less
than 128 bytes of data.
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   Each <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>trades oﬀ various properties. We chose a
tripartite system so that appropriate choices can be made for
diﬀerent use cases. Here, we explore the various properties we
chose by following a series of binary choices—the idea
maze.
</p><!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   One way to classify <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki</span>s is by permanence: either you can
change your keys or not. If you cannot, then your name is
impermanent, for no one can keep a set of keys secure forever.
Even if your opsec never fails, eventually your crypto
algorithms may be compromised.
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   However, if you sacriﬁce the ability to change your keys,
you can achieve a very nice property: self-attesting keys. If
your name is a hash of your public key information, then no
other source of information is required to verify you are who
you say you are. This is a useful property since it requires
no coordination at all. Many things are impermanent,
especially during development. It also provides a way
                                                
                                                
to try out the network without obtaining a permanent
address.
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   This is our ﬁrst stop in the idea maze. We call this sort of
name a “comet”. A comet’s name is the 128-bit hash of its public
keys.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a  id="x1-2f1"></a> 
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   However, Urbit is yours and it’s forever. You shouldn’t
have to change your name every time you change your keys.
So, we go back and take the other choice: you must be able to
change your keys.
</p><!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   To change keys, you must sign a message with
the old keys revoking them and supplying the new
ones<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a  id="x1-3f2"></a> .
The question is what happens if the old keys also sign a
second set of new keys. This could happen if an attacker
obtained your old keys after the fact. This is important
because one of the reasons to be able to change your
keys is to invalidate the old ones so that they have no
power.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   We have two options again: the <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>may be globally
consistent or not. To be globally consistent means that if you
believe a name is bound to a set of keys, then nobody on the
network will disagree.
</p><!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   If you don’t require global consistency, you may sign this
message and send it to all your neighbors, and they pass it on,
and hopefully it gets to most of the network quickly. However,
if one of those ships receives two contradictory versions of this
message, the only thing it can do is trust the ﬁrst one it heard,
which may be diﬀerent than what someone else heard. Thus,
this is pairwise consistent but globally inconsistent. This is
essentially how the pre-blockchain Ames network worked,
though key changes were not actually implemented. Because
                                                
                                                
global consistency is a valuable property, we looked at other
options.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   For a globally consistent <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>that allows you to revoke
keys, you need to be able to distinguish between two
cryptographically valid messages to determine which was
signed ﬁrst. The dual problem could be solved easily — you
can prove a message is signed after another by including the
signature of the ﬁrst in the second. This is equivalent to
reading out a newspaper headline to prove a message was
recorded after a given day.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   However, the problem of proving one message was sent
before any later ones inverts the problem. You can solve this
with newspapers by placing the message in the text of the
newspaper. However, while reading a newspaper requires no
central party, writing one does. For a long time, this sort
of message was always handled by a central party. <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">ssl</span>
revocations are managed by a few central parties. When you
buy property, it’s not suﬃcient to have the previous owner
sign the title — this must be entered into a central land
registry. Otherwise, the owner may sell their property to
multiple people and there would be no way to determine who
is the new owner. With the land registry, all you need to do is
ask the registry which sale happened ﬁrst, and that’s the one
that counts.
</p><!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >   However, Urbit is yours and it’s forever. Trusting central
registries jeopardizes both. The keen reader will notice that
the problem of determining which key rotation happened ﬁrst
is exactly the double-spend problem that Satoshi solved with
his proof of work algorithm for Bitcoin. His ﬁrst block
famously includes a newspaper headline to prove he didn’t
mine the block before that date. In a beautiful duality, his
own algorithm proves that he didn’t mine it after that
date.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a  id="x1-4f3"></a> 
                                                
                                                
</p><!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   Some argue that blockchain is only good for money. This is
myopic and is generally based on the experience that its most
valuable application so far has been money. However,
blockchain is a cryptographic primitive to do what was
previously impossible: prove that one message was signed
before another without a central party. Blockchain was
discovered by someone trying to create digital money, and he
needed that primitive, but that doesn’t mean that’s all it’s
good for.
</p><!--l. 161--><p class="indent" >   Thus, we store our <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>data on a blockchain for our
second kind of name: planets. A planet is a 32-bit
address which has key information stored on the
blockchain.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn4x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a  id="x1-7f4"></a> 
The owner of a planet may broadcast new <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>data by adding
it to the blockchain. Any later messages by the old keys will
be rejected, and everyone on the network will listen to the
blockchain for key data. Thus, we have global consistency,
permanence, and self sovereignty. We know of no other
solution that can provide these properties.
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   However, while small individually, the aggregate <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>data
for all nodes on the network may become very large. This is
not an issue for comets because nobody needs to store comet
keys except for those which they’re talking with, and even
those can be garbage-collected and re-requested and veriﬁed.
For planets, there is a canonical set of keys, and somebody
must store that. There are about 232, or 4 billion planets. If
the <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>data is about 100 bytes for each planet, this is
about 400 GB of data. This may be more than most
users wish to store, but it’s small enough that it would
be very cheap for someone to host this data for many
users.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn5x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a  id="x1-8f5"></a> 
                                                
                                                
</p><!--l. 187--><p class="indent" >   This information is currently stored directly on the
Ethereum blockchain, but as is well understood in blockchain
circles this approach will not scale beyond a certain point.
Many chains are pursuing designs that allow the users of the
smart contracts to locally store the data associated with the
contracts they care about and only commit hashes to the
chain. We expect there to be several viable options for this by
the time Azimuth’s scaling needs exceed what’s provided
by Ethereum. This will free us from the cost of hosting
the <span 
class="ec-lmcsc-10">pki </span>data on all Ethereum nodes, but the data must
still be stored somewhere. Any service that could handle
such a large amount of data would inherently centralize
the network. Azimuth and Jael make reference to an
external source of truth for their own and peer’s key
information, but do not otherwise depend on Ethereum for
their operation.
</p><!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >   However, 4 billion is not enough addresses for every device
on the planet today, much less in a few decades. So, we apply
our maxim of re-examining our choices at each level for each
use case. Examining the idea maze above, we cannot use the
blockchain option for everything since the data is too big.
However, it’s not actually necessary for each of your devices to
have its own self-sovereign identity separate from your planet.
So we choose the option of using a central registry: your own
planet.
</p><!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   We allocate 4 billion “moons” to each of those planets. A
moon is a 64-bit address whose 32-bit suﬃx is its planet.
Your planet can easily store the keys for its own moons,
and anyone who needs to talk to your moons can ask
you for the keys. This is the sense in which moons are
true ships: they’re permanent names and you own them
completely, as long as you own the planet. However, they’re
not independent ships — their keys can always be revoked by
their planet.
