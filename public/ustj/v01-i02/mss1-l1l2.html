<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >The nature of identity has captivated human attention since
prehistory. Cave painting self-portraits and handprints reveal
an early sense of ‘self’ in even the earliest hominids. More
recently, Descartes’ <span 
class="ec-lmri-10">cogito, ergo sum </span>laid the groundwork for
modern philosophy. As we move into the digital age, the
                                                
                                                
concept of ‘identity’ continues to evolve in order to extend into
online networks.
</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   This article considers the concept of identity within
the context of Urbit and its identity layer, Azimuth.
We explore how these systems implement decentralized
identity, examining their technical foundations, practical
applications, and the broader implications for digital
self-sovereignty. By understanding these elements, we aim to
shed light on the future of identity in a decentralized
world.

‘self-sovereign identity’ (<span class="small-caps">ssi</span>) to concretize a notion of digital
decentralized identity built for individual control and
self-determination (<a  id="x1-3005"></a> Allen, 2016). He noted that the evolution
of online identity has passed through eras of centralized
administrative control, oligarchic federated systems, and
unfortunately, institutionally captured “user-centric”
designs. The next era, designated the era of <span class="small-caps">ssi</span>, thankfully
aims to return us to a more intuitive understanding of

<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >As <code>~wicdev-wisryt</code> noted of the public key infrastructure (<span class="small-caps">pki</span>)
idea maze (see <a  id="x1-4001"></a> <code>~wicdev-wisryt</code> (2024), pp. 1–7 in this
issue), the long history of <span class="small-caps">pki</span>s largely splits between being
‘decentralized and unused’ or ‘centralized and easy to
subject oneself to’. <code>~wicdev-wisryt</code> explored this idea maze
along the branches of global consistency, permanence, and
self-ownership, to which we add a fourth branch: sane
defaults.
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >   <span class="small-caps">pgp</span>, <span class="small-caps">gpg</span>, and Web of Trust solutions have existed for
decades but are used by eﬀectively nobody, and in some sense
can be dismissed due to a lack of sane defaults. One could
argue the shortcoming of these systems is a lack of global
consistency, but in practice global consistency is a necessary
but not suﬃcient condition for a self-sovereign identity.
If the system does not also provide sane defaults the
global consistency remains an illegible mess to the typical
user. The Web of Trust and similar solutions may be
glossed over as demonstrably insuﬃcient thanks to this
shortcoming.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   If we consider global consistency, permanence, and
self-ownership as useful goals for the <span class="small-caps">pki</span>, we must recognize
                                                
                                                
that they fail to explain some of the more controversial
elements of Azimuth’s hierarchical model for a certain
subset of critics. In fact, alternate conceptions for <span class="small-caps">pki</span>s
and identity more broadly are being explored by both
Kinode<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a  id="x1-4002f3"></a> 
and Pallas.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn4x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a  id="x1-4003f4"></a> 
These projects aim to satisfy each of the three branches but
take diﬀerent approaches to the concept of sane defaults. So
why does Urbit’s Azimuth retain a hierarchical address
space?
</p><!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   Aside from being a clean way of naming a ﬁnite address
space, Azimuth’s hierarchy provides a <span 
class="ec-lmri-10">sane default </span>for packet
routing, peer discovery, and third-party service provision. It
gives users a starting point, and a set of alternatives that are
tractable. It serves as the crisis moment (‘It’s dangerous to go
alone! Take this’) before embarking on the journey of
self-sovereign identity.

there is no reason that a particular Urbit ship must exclusively

<!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" >The need to place the <span class="small-caps">pki</span> on a distributed ledger with
global consensus and recognize the hierarchical model as
a sane default is obvious. But what about the current
address space and its technical implementation? Since
early 2019, Azimuth has been on hosted on the Ethereum
blockchain, and in 2022 the contracts were updated to support
a “naive” Layer 2 rollup. Returning to the principles
and design goals of <span class="small-caps">ssi</span> and <span class="small-caps">did</span>s, this on-chain presence
provides beneﬁts such as existence, control, transparency,
persistence, decentralization, and discoverability. It also
supports many of the other stated goals, if not satisfying
them purely through an on-chain presence. Many of these
principles were either explicitly or implicitly considered with
both the initial Azimuth contracts (<a  id="x1-5001"></a> <code>~ravmel-ropdyl</code>,
2019), and the move to supporting the Layer 2 rollup
(<a  id="x1-5002"></a> <code>~datnut-pollen</code>, 2021). However, the current state of
Azimuth falls short in terms of providing interoperability and
extensibility.

of the <span class="small-caps">erc</span>-721 standard (<a  id="x1-6001"></a> Entriken et al., 2018). It is

which deﬁnes the business logic for updating the state of
the registry. To this day, these contracts serve as one of
the most technically ‘useful’ <span class="small-caps">erc</span>-721s on the Ethereum

Ethereum network in the form of gas fees. This interaction can
be particularly expensive because the original versions of
Ecliptic required all state transition computations to occur
on-chain. While this means Azimuth inherits the security
beneﬁts of Ethereum’s global consensus model, there is a

<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >The transaction costs on Ethereum were so great that, at

introduced (<a  id="x1-7001"></a> <code>~datnut-pollen</code>, 2021): a custom ‘naive’ rollup.
The key feature of the naive rollup is that, instead of paying
Ethereum miners (now validators) to verify the state
transitions of Azimuth, each Urbit node can validate those
transitions themselves. This again brings us back to the
idea of sane defaults in a decentralized or distributed
network.
</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   That is, in running one’s Urbit instance, the canonical
“Azimuth” is nothing more than a sane default. This is
trivially exempliﬁed by the fact that one could run a fake ship

deploy an alternative version of Azimuth onto mainnet
Ethereum. However, because everyone else is likely operating
on the default version of <code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">/app/azimuth</span></code>, which assumes
<code class="lstinline"><span style="color:#000000">azimuth.eth</span></code> as The One True <span class="small-caps">pki</span>, any of one’s potential
peers will discard one’s packets as invalid. The Urbit
network will ignore an unsignable interloper. Whether or
not the Urbit network pays the Ethereum network for
state transition computation, it remains true that Urbit’s

distinguish two cryptographically valid messages, speciﬁcally
which was signed ﬁrst, without requiring a centralized party.
Both Layer 1 and Layer 2 implementations rely on this
aﬀordance. Eﬀectively, they both need the chain to give them
a timestamp and a signed message to discern key ownership.
Whether the cosmputation of key rotation is done on-chain
or client side, anyone within the Urbit network that is
continuing to use the system defaults will ultimately get the
correct result for validating a packet’s sender. It is the
core aﬀordance of timestamped messages for which Urbit
must pay <span

be a failure of imagination to claim there is no contingent loss
of beneﬁts. Speciﬁcally, Ethereum is a growing network that is
building on top of the same <span class="small-caps">erc</span>-721 standard on which
Urbit ID is deﬁned. Improvements to the capabilities of

the Urbit community. A recent debate throughout the
ecosystem about the Azimuth <span class="small-caps">pki</span>, namely between Zenith and
Mayﬂower, has instigated a wide-ranging discussion about
alternative ways of handling identiy across the Urbit network.
GroundWire proposes to experiment with both new <span class="small-caps">pki</span>
governance models, and to make use of the comet-level address
space in a more robust way (<a  id="x1-16002"></a> <code>~hastuc-dibtux</code> et al., 2024).
Implementation details are still forthcoming, but the initial
plan is to prototype a Gall agent to support a <span class="small-caps">pki</span> on Bitcoin
that would allow comets to rotate their keys (updating the
current ‘self-attestation’ model), and make use of diﬀerent
non-hierarchical models for routing and peer-discovery.
Additionally, instead of using the ﬁnite ‘higher level’ address
space for spam resistance, this proposal would use mechanisms
like L1 Bitcoin fee costs, or burning and timelocking
coins.

GroundWire proposal makes statements about the governance
and fundrasing directions of the Urbit project. These topics

become or remain illegible to the outside world. Private

     should   involve   the   minimum   amount   of   data
     necessary  to  accomplish  the  task  at  hand.  For
     example, if only a minimum age is called for, then
     the exact age should not be disclosed, and if only
     an  age  is  requested,  then  the  more  precise  date
     of  birth  should  not  be  disclosed.  This  principle
     can  be  supported  with  selective  disclosure,  range
     proofs,  and  other  zero-knowledge  techniques,  but
     non-correlatibility  is  still  a  very  hard  (perhaps
     impossible)  task;  the  best  we  can  do  is  to  use
     minimalization to support privacy as best as possible.
